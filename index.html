		<p class="intro">Vince is a four-year old pitbull terrier/french bulldog mix who lives in St. Louis, MO. His stature may be on the small side, but his 30lbs of muscle projects a dog who's not to be messed with. He's sensitive, inquisitive, loyal and protective. He's the only one of his kind. He's Vince. </p>
